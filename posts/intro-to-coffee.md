I'm back! After the long push to get the "v1" of this site up I took some time away to catch up on other parts of my life. There was a real danger of me never returning, but it turns out I actually do like this thing a little bit. Knowing I have a Real Blog has actually made it a bit more fun to shower-think because it feels like I'm both my own writer (coming up with different ideas and angles all the time) and editor (trying to internally draft those thoughts as blog posts and deciding which ones sound the most entertaining to read and write). I guess I am my own writer and editor, just without the amusing mental image of a little guy running between desks with ink stains and papers flying everywhere.

Here is a rundown/review of all the coffee-related gear I currently own, plus backstory:

## The Breville Barista Express
I do not own it and it is also not current... It's my parents' machine and they have since moved on to a new one. But this was really the start of things for me.

My mom and dad bought this long, long before I ever cared about coffee. I'd tried a sip of their lattes once or twice but never felt inclined to have more than that. They loved it though and got years of consistent use out of it. This may have actually been their second one, I can't remember. I'd also learned to make lattes on it at some point so I could make them for my grandparents. I tried and failed to make latte art a couple times over the years. At the beginning of this year I decided to give it a real shot, just because I had time now and it sounded easy enough and fun. So I watched a bunch of YouTube videos and started asking people if they wanted coffee.

My first attempts were pretty funny but I think I'll save the pictures for my upcoming latte art page. The whole thing turned out to be more difficult than expected. I had to learn about milk texture, vortexes, ripping paper, and the effectiveness of human skin as an accurate thermometer. And that's all before the part where you actually do the pouring part. All this meant I needed more practice reps. I could max out the 2 cups a day my parents drank if I got up early enough, but progress was still slow and there was a lot that could go wrong in each attempt. I had to rule out making a third daily cup for myself for a few reasons. One, my parents drink caffeinated coffee and I avoid all routine consumption of caffeine. Two, I couldn't use decaf beans^[I've learned people often have misconceptions about decaf coffee. Here are a few common {% include "helpers/external-link.html" href:"https://levelground.com/blogs/blog/decaf-coffee-myths" text:"myths about decaf" %}. TLDR: decaf beans can be an excellent and serious alternative for people like me who enjoy the taste of high-quality coffee but want to opt out of significant caffeine consumption for whatever reason.] because the Barista Express has a bean hopper that is messy and difficult to empty (so switching it from caf to decaf and back daily wasn't feasible). Three, given that I didn't actually *like* the taste of coffee it felt a bit wasteful to make an extra latte every day just to practice the art.

After watching a ton of YouTube and reading a ton of Reddit threads, I started to believe what people were telling me -- that black coffee isn't always "bitter", and that it can actually taste quite pleasant if brewed with some care. This is also the time when I discovered {% include "helpers/external-link.html" href:"https://www.youtube.com/@issackxcoffee" text:"IssackxCoffee" %}^[I am probably his biggest fan. During a phase where I dreamed of working as a barista I forced my friends, family, SO, and dog to watch all his POV barista vlogs on repeat, all day. For someone who doesn't really talk much in his videos I feel like I do know a lot of lore about him and I reference his content all the time. I also truly believe I would kick ass day one if I ever got hired at his shop, lol. Opening or closing shift.] and {% include "helpers/external-link.html" href:"https://www.youtube.com/@jameshoffmann" text:"James Hoffmann" %}, who is like the fairy godfather of coffee people. I decided my best course was to spend as little money as I could on a coffee grinder good enough to work with the 3-cup Moka pot my mom found in our garage. I planned to try my hand at making "good-tasting", espresso-like coffee with that setup, some Trader Joe's decaf beans, and the steam wand on the Barista Express. It happened that my birthday was coming up and my parents were nice enough to offer to buy me my very own grinder as an early gift.

## The OXO Brew Conical Burr Coffee Grinder
My mom found this on a NYT Wirecutter article. I think I can be a difficult person to buy gifts for so my parents jumped on this potential new interest of mine right away. I was absolutely stoked.

## The Bialetti "Moka Express" 3-Cup
I had so much fun with this thing. The Moka pot is a brewer that uses steam pressure in the base to push hot water through a bed of ground coffee in the middle chamber, then through a filter and spout leading to the top chamber where the brewed coffee-water is collected. Most people consider the stuff that comes out of this thing as separate and distinct from espresso due to the lower brew pressure. However, it's still a very concentrated solution and strong enough to stand up to steamed milk. Which was good enough for me.

After only a few weeks, I realized that I was going to sleep every night incredibly excited to wake up the next morning and make a better cup of coffee. I started to take little sips of it black to check the natural taste before I added milk for the art. Soon I created a spreadsheet (I know lol) to help me track the variables and outputs for my daily brews. It's pretty rare that you find new things to look forward to every single day, so I took it as a sign and made a relatively large investment.

## The DF54
An incredible amount of real research as well as Reddit validation-seeking doom-searching went into buying this grinder. I wanted something solidly built that could make cafe-quality espresso (or better). And at the lowest price possible, of course. Debatably^[Won't get into specifics here. But there are plenty of alternatives of course at moderately higher price points that people prefer. Trust me that I considered them all...], that thing actually exists and is a Chinese-made flat-burr grinder called the DF54. With this grinder I could produce grinds fine enough to hold up to the higher pressure of my parents' espresso machine, which meant I could pull true espresso shots with my decaf beans.

Over $200 for a coffee grinder probably sounds absolutely wild to someone who hasn't done the deep dive into the cost of making "great" espresso at home. And then I dare to call that "relatively cheap". Coffee for most of the world is just a vehicle for caffeine -- you bear the unpleasant taste for the useful effect. And that's perfectly understandable. Having done that deep dive, I do find it pretty interesting how completely ubiquitous yet mostly unacknowledged coffee is. I couldn't blame you for being surprised that the adults of the world don't give just a *little* more thought to something they put in their bodies every day (often multiple times!). I think many people (myself, for example) have learned culturally that drinking black coffee feels a lot like a swig of vodka in the morning, except that you become day-awake instead of day-drunk. There's also the thing where liking black coffee or liking coffee in general puts you on the "snob" spectrum and that's just kind of sad to me. There are a ton of degrees of "better" and even "very, very tasty" between a Folgers can or Nespresso pod and myself, at the low-end-of-high-end, that don't require being a nerd or obscene spending and I wish more people were aware of that. Pretty much any non-espresso grinder (the OXO Brew is a great example), a French press, and some quality whole bean coffee^[Here is one area where I've come to feel strongly that spending more is worth it (and probably morally imperative) even for those not interested in coffee as a hobby. Firstly, there is a sort of hierarchy of the factors that determine the "tastiness" of a cup of coffee. It's universally agreed upon that it begins with the quality of the roasted bean. The quality of your grinder is usually next. More importantly, the reality of the coffee growing industry in its current state insists that, below a certain price threshold along the lines of $15 for a 12oz bag it is nearly a guarantee that people in the supply chain are being exploited. I think there is an outdated cultural notion of what a bag of coffee or a drink from a cafe should cost, and that historically low price has been built on the back of a lot of suffering, sadly. At the end of the day coffee is a luxury. There are other ways to get caffeine if you absolutely need it. You can get great coffee at $18 a bag, world-class coffee at $30 a bag, and the best, rarest, most complex coffees in the world at under $100 a bag. Compare that to the price of a more culturally accepted luxury good like wine. Just like wine, producing high-quality single-origin coffee requires unique growing conditions, expensive land, year-round manual labor from growers and pickers, importers, exporters, and special processing equipment. And when you factor in that a single bag of coffee makes dozens of individual cups of coffee, maybe things begin to come into perspective.

## The Cafelat Robot
- espresso machines: hot*(variable) water at pressure*(profiling), plus milk steaming

## What I'm working on now
good on gear for foreseeable future
- different types of beans
- water: getting really nerdy. the crystal geyser bottling plant chart lol

last week I was away visiting people in SoCal. had a really sad gas station coffee for the drive that I used to think was fine. also a just-fine decaf americano at a cafe. came back home and immediately pulled a shot and it  put a huge ridiculous smile on my face. something to be said about not always drinking the "best" stuff, puts things in perspective. made me feel good about the time and money i've invested
