- experience building with JS frameworks
- felt like _using expensive tool for simple job metaphor_. and we had never used a _simple tool_ before
- "why are these frameworks so widespread/celebrated if they made such a slow, bloated mess of what should've been simple applications?"
  1.  my lack of experience / user error
  2.  given that, it was too easy to write things that work well enough to consider done, but not well enough to feel joy using them
      - for a learner, the level of abstraction offered by a powerful tool like React is just too high in my opinion. flying a fighter jet before knowing what drag is.
- alex russell, my first time hearing someone talk about accessibility and performance for the web. my first exposure to any kind of meta-commentary on the state of the web. this had been completely absent from discussion in my university classes and clubs! divisive figure, I personally found myself excited to see someone with such strong critiques about something very popular (JS frameworks) that I had been led to use and accept as synonymous with "web development".
  - i loved that he wasn't really shilling any alternative turnkey solution [link to if not react... blog](). certainly not another framework. he wants to make the web more friendly for people who don't have a $3k laptop, for mobile users, for people with disabilities, etc.
  - my previous exposure to the web through classes and clubs had been very oriented towards "this is cutting-edge", "this is industry-standard", "this is very cool and will get you a Job". i truly don't think that any of these things are in any way false, by the way. but none of my peers were asking any of the questions I was. i just liked that alex's writings essentially doubled the size of my conception of what the web is. basically, i became very curious!
- now: still at very beginnings of my career, my knowledge of the web, etc. now interested in building a small personal site (see previous post), i saw this as my first opportunity to try and put into practice some of these new ideas that had been swirling around in my mind over the past several months, where school and work hadn't always allowed experimenting with alternative tech. the small, static nature of a personal website made it even more of a perfect testing ground for me.

- how i came to eleventy
  - at first wanted to try self-hosting, using a language I'd been wanting to learn, etc. but i remembered that the end product of this process will ultimately be a landing page for my online and offline, personal and professional presence. so i began looking for tools that would Just Work. Things that are proven reliable and mirror my newly-earned interest in accessibility, reliability, and performance above all -- rather than maybe looking cool or anything particularly flashy. I wanted to represent myself and the values of the kind of programmer I am and hope to become one day.
  - I saw eleventy being used and pushed by other people with these kinds of beliefs that I admired. people with a lot of passion for what they do and what they create.

part 2: building it

- dive in headfirst. i became very aware of just how much I didn't know about the web. its history, past efforts to guide it one way or another, the legacies of those efforts and how they affect the way we build today, etc. that also meant i got distracted easily, reading decades-old forum posts, mdn docs. it slowed my progress towards a finished site I could put on my resume, but it sped up my progress towards becoming a better programmer. i didn't feel a need to rush anyways. building my website has been one of the few things I've done where there is no real time constraint. I wanted something uniquely mine, something I could feel proud of, something I could expand upon and update through the forseeable future.

- in other words, it was kinda hard. one one hand, i was building a website, and a simple one at that. I'd built websites before that were much more complex. On the other hand, you can see that I had some pretty lofty aspirations for it from the start. I had to actively resist the urge to build a deep, intimate understanding of everything remotely related (and often unrelated) to the tools I was using. Having deadlines made it easier to justify minimally acceptable, if perhaps unsatisfying understandings when necessary. I am learning to quickly and aggressively pick and choose the rabbit holes I go down, following my gut and previous experience to guide me towards tangents that would maximize tangible returns on my time investments. I do feel that this is a skill one builds over a lifetime.

part 3: anyways, here it is (alt. beautiful dreams of a young, naive code monkey meet the cold, hard reality that is writing functional software) (alt. alt. just put the fries in the bag bro)
so, yeah. i don't think it would've been possible for this site to fulfill all my grandest visions for who I am and what websites can be. writing software means getting a little dirty and pragmatic sometimes. and I have much to learn... but I do like it, and it's mine and that makes me happy. it's the first time I felt I could express something about myself personally through a piece of code I wrote -- a great benefit of becoming opinionated, even if in a small way. any shortcomings or avenues left unexplored (intentional or otherwise) are just motivation to write more and better software in the future.

this was a lot of fun to build and write about. thanks for reading!
