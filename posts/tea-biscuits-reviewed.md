I've always been a little bit fascinated by the concept of "tea" -- as in the distinct light meal of small foods and hot tea usually taken in the late afternoon. Like many of my long-lasting fixations I think it probably has its roots in those staples of English children's fantasy literature: mainly <i>The Hobbit</i>, but also The <i>Harry Potter</i> series^[I have since renounced my ties to this franchise due to the author's bigoted views.], etc. I loved those scenes where in the midst of a long and arduous journey, the protagonists are allowed the brief respite of a warm meal by the fire, to break into a precious reserve from home, buried deep in the pocket of a tattered coat, lovingly wrapped up and carried through miles of rain and snow, through dense forests and over impossibly tall mountains, miraculously surviving fierce battles and mad dashes to safety. Their troubles are far from over, but for just a moment the challenges of the day are allowed to drift ever so slightly out of mind.

These sorts of scenes came to mind frequently during my undergrad. Those nights where I'd be so innundated with work that I'd have to force myself to step away for just 15 minutes to have something to eat that day. Even when my body and mind were completely wracked with stress, I found true comfort and shelter in those brief pauses. The ever-present deadlines and pressure had no choice but to wait for me to finish. After all, what kind of messed up world would have Bilbo ambushed while enjoying his second breakfast?? I bookmarked this {% include "helpers/external-link.html" text:"essay about the magic of food in fiction" href:"https://womenwriteaboutcomics.com/2017/01/food-in-film-finding-safe-spaces-in-fiction/" %} a long time ago which does a much better job than I can of articulating this idea.

So to bring us back to the point of this post: I love the idea of taking tea (the beverage) and turning it into the much more indulgent Tea (the meal). A break during the day to stop and replenish yourself, and perhaps be a little bit extra. Well I'm sure the English take it quite seriously, and I love that for them!

Final note before the reviews. While searching for the header image for this post I found this {% include "helpers/external-link.html" text:"lovely little blog by Nicola Thomis" href:"https://www.fragrantica.com/news/Scents-of-England-Tea-and-Biscuits-19857.html" %} about English tea culture, biscuits, and an unexpectedly interesting review of several tea- and biscuit-inspired fragrances. You should totally check it out :D It's obviously a pretty light-hearted subject but you can tell the author is extremely knowledgeable about fragrances.

Thank you very much for reading my first review. I hope some of you appreciated my English-themed biscuit adjectives for the captions. I hope to do more reviews like this in the future!
